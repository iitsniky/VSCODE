            <h2>About Pandora</h2>

            <p>Pandora Rosier was born in 1960 into the influential Rosier family, one of the oldest pure-blood lines in
                Britain. She was the younger of a set of twins, her brother Evan Rosier arriving only minutes before
                her. Though the Rosier family held deeply traditional views, Pandora’s childhood was marked by an
                unusual freedom of thought. While Evan embraced the pride and responsibilities expected of a Rosier
                heir, Pandora often strayed toward curiosity, books, and experimentation.</p>
            <p>The twins shared an inseparable bond. They communicated almost wordlessly, and though their personalities
                diverged—Evan stern and guarded, Pandora open and inquisitive—they complemented one another perfectly.
                To many, they seemed like two halves of the same soul.</p>

            <h2>Hogwarts Years</h2>
            <p>When the siblings arrived at Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat separated them: Evan was placed in Slytherin, as
                expected of a Rosier, while Pandora surprised her family by being sorted into Ravenclaw. This caused a
                stir in pure-blood circles, who saw it as a deviation from tradition, but Pandora embraced the change
                with pride.</p>
            <p>At Ravenclaw, she thrived academically. Pandora possessed a brilliantly inventive mind, often lingering
                in the library until closing hours. She was fascinated by experimental charms, complex spell theory, and
                the possibilities of blending different magical disciplines. Her professors quickly noticed her natural
                aptitude, though her experiments sometimes ended in spectacular accidents.</p>
            <p>However, beneath her composed exterior, Pandora grappled with the complexities of her family's
                expectations. The Rosiers were known for their pure-blood supremacist ideals, and Pandora often found
                herself at odds with their views. Her twin brother Evan, already on a path that aligned with their
                family's beliefs, was a constant reminder of the divide between her personal values and her heritage.
            </p>
            <p>Despite house divisions, Pandora and Evan remained close. Late at night, they often sneaked away to meet,
                sharing stories of their houses and secrets from their respective social circles.</p>

            <h2>Pandora & Evan</h2>
            <p>Pandora and Evan shared a unique bond. Despite their differing paths, they communicated through subtle
                glances and shared memories. Pandora often found herself torn between her loyalty to her brother and her
                desire to forge her own identity. Their relationship was a complex tapestry of love, rivalry, and
                unspoken understanding.</p>
            <p>Evan, aware of Pandora's internal struggles, tried to shield her from the darker aspects of the wizarding
                world.</p>

            <h2>Physical appearance</h2>
            <p>Pandora Rosier is a striking young witch with a rich, deep brown complexion that seems to glow with
                warmth in the sunlight. Her long, wavy blonde hair cascades freely down her back, catching the light and
                giving her an almost ethereal presence.</p>
            <p>She moves with quiet grace, her slender frame carrying a natural elegance that draws attention without
                effort. At Hogwarts, she wears her uniform with meticulous care, often adding subtle touches like small
                charms or a silk scarf in Ravenclaw blue, while outside of school, she favors flowing robes and dresses
                in muted jewel tones of blues, silvers, and grays. Small details—like the faint crescent-shaped scar on
                her wrist or the occasional ink smudge from long hours of studying—lend her a humanized, relatable charm
                amidst her composed and polished appearance.</p>
