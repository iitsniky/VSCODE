            <h2>About Pandora</h2>
            
            <p>Pandora Rosier was born in 1960 into the influential Rosier family, one of the oldest pure-blood lines in Britain. She was the younger of a set of twins, her brother Evan Rosier arriving only minutes before her. Though the Rosier family held deeply traditional views, Pandora’s childhood was marked by an unusual freedom of thought. While Evan embraced the pride and responsibilities expected of a Rosier heir, Pandora often strayed toward curiosity, books, and experimentation.</p>
            <p>The twins shared an inseparable bond. They communicated almost wordlessly, and though their personalities diverged—Evan stern and guarded, Pandora open and inquisitive—they complemented one another perfectly. To many, they seemed like two halves of the same soul.</p>
            <h2>Hogwarts Years</h2>
            <p>When the siblings arrived at Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat separated them: Evan was placed in Slytherin, as expected of a Rosier, while Pandora surprised her family by being sorted into Ravenclaw. This caused a stir in pure-blood circles, who saw it as a deviation from tradition, but Pandora embraced the change with pride.</p>
            <p>At Ravenclaw, she thrived academically. Pandora possessed a brilliantly inventive mind, often lingering in the library until closing hours. She was fascinated by experimental charms, complex spell theory, and the possibilities of blending different magical disciplines. Her professors quickly noticed her natural aptitude, though her experiments sometimes ended in spectacular accidents.</p>
            <p>Despite house divisions, Pandora and Evan remained close. Late at night, they often sneaked away to meet, sharing stories of their houses and secrets from their respective social circles.</p>

            <h2>Physical appearance</h2>
            <p>Pandora was striking in both looks and presence. She carried herself with quiet confidence, her warm, darker-toned complexion contrasting vividly with her cascade of pale blonde hair. Her eyes were sharp and searching, always alight with curiosity. She dressed with elegance but had a penchant for personal touches—silver trinkets, odd hairpins, and accessories collected from her experiments.</p>
            <p>Her unusual appearance made her memorable among her peers; she stood out as someone who seemed both firmly of the wizarding world and yet slightly apart from it, a dreamer grounded in intellect.</p>
