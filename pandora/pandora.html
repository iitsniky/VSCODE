            <h2>About Pandora</h2>
            
            <p>Pandora Rosier was born in 1960 into the influential Rosier family, one of the oldest pure-blood lines in Britain. She was the younger of a set of twins, her brother Evan Rosier arriving only minutes before her. Though the Rosier family held deeply traditional views, Pandora’s childhood was marked by an unusual freedom of thought. While Evan embraced the pride and responsibilities expected of a Rosier heir, Pandora often strayed toward curiosity, books, and experimentation.</p>
            <p>The twins shared an inseparable bond. They communicated almost wordlessly, and though their personalities diverged—Evan stern and guarded, Pandora open and inquisitive—they complemented one another perfectly. To many, they seemed like two halves of the same soul.</p>

            <h2>Hogwarts Years</h2>
            <p>When the siblings arrived at Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat separated them: Evan was placed in Slytherin, as expected of a Rosier, while Pandora surprised her family by being sorted into Ravenclaw. This caused a stir in pure-blood circles, who saw it as a deviation from tradition, but Pandora embraced the change with pride.</p>
            <p>At Ravenclaw, she thrived academically. Pandora possessed a brilliantly inventive mind, often lingering in the library until closing hours. She was fascinated by experimental charms, complex spell theory, and the possibilities of blending different magical disciplines. Her professors quickly noticed her natural aptitude, though her experiments sometimes ended in spectacular accidents.</p>
            <p>However, beneath her composed exterior, Pandora grappled with the complexities of her family's expectations. The Rosiers were known for their pure-blood supremacist ideals, and Pandora often found herself at odds with their views. Her twin brother Evan, already on a path that aligned with their family's beliefs, was a constant reminder of the divide between her personal values and her heritage.</p>
            <p>Despite house divisions, Pandora and Evan remained close. Late at night, they often sneaked away to meet, sharing stories of their houses and secrets from their respective social circles.</p>

            <h2>Pandora & Evan</h2>
            <p>Pandora and Evan shared a unique bond. Despite their differing paths, they communicated through subtle glances and shared memories. Pandora often found herself torn between her loyalty to her brother and her desire to forge her own identity. Their relationship was a complex tapestry of love, rivalry, and unspoken understanding.</p>
            <p>Evan, aware of Pandora's internal struggles, tried to shield her from the darker aspects of the wizarding world.</p>

            <h2>Physical appearance</h2>
            <p>Pandora Rosier is a striking young witch with a rich, deep brown complexion that seems to glow with warmth in the sunlight. Her long, wavy blonde hair cascades freely down her back, catching the light and giving her an almost ethereal presence.</p>
            <p>She moves with quiet grace, her slender frame carrying a natural elegance that draws attention without effort. At Hogwarts, she wears her uniform with meticulous care, often adding subtle touches like small charms or a silk scarf in Ravenclaw blue, while outside of school, she favors flowing robes and dresses in muted jewel tones of blues, silvers, and grays. Small details—like the faint crescent-shaped scar on her wrist or the occasional ink smudge from long hours of studying—lend her a humanized, relatable charm amidst her composed and polished appearance.</p>
